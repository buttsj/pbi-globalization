> A PowerBI visualization to show data through Latitudes and Longitudes

## How it works

Give the visualization a latitude + longitude coordinate, as well as a data value to build at that location.

## Installing this Visualization

Navigate to the /dist/ folder and import the .pbiviz file into your PBI Desktop/Web App report.
